        “Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.”<br>—John 12:24 (NIV)

        Every parent wants a children's storybook to be appealing, fun, and full of life lessons. There is no other book that meets the requirement better than Apple.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story follows Apple, who waits quietly in a tree and wonders when his time will come. With warmth and gentle humor in the book, young readers are drawn into a colorful adventure with Apple that sparks curiosity and encourages imagination.
      </p>

        Parents will appreciate positive message woven into the tale — a reminder that even the tiniest beginnings can grow into a wonderful life.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Ideal for bedtime or classroom reading, Apple is more than a story. It is an invitation for children to giggle, dream, and imagine together — even when their ideas are a little bit silly.
