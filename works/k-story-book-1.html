        Korea is more than K-pop, dramas, and movies—it is a land with deep roots, 
        where myths of heavenly princes, legends of brilliant generals, and tales 
        of wise kings and queens shaped a nation’s destiny.
      </p>
      <p>
        Book 1: Ancient Kingdoms takes readers back to the very beginning. 
        From the first people of the Korean peninsula to the rise of Goguryeo, 
        Baekje, and Silla, this book tells how small villages grew into mighty kingdoms. 
        Along the way, readers will meet a bear who became a queen, kings who claimed the 
        mandate of Heaven, and a princess whose marriage changed history. They will hear 
        songs of sorrow and triumph, discover the first laws and schools, and watch as 
        Korea faced massive invasions yet stood firm against the greatest empire of the age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each chapter blends mystical legend, documented history, and beautiful songs side 
        by side—showing how the spirit of storytelling and poetry that once stirred ancient 
        villages still lives on today in K-dramas and K-pop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created especially for Korean American children and families, this book helps young 
        readers connect with their heritage while inviting all readers to explore the epic 
        story of Korea’s ancient past. With heroes and heroines, battles and betrayals, and 
        timeless lessons of courage and resilience, Ancient Kingdoms is the unforgettable 
        first step into Korea’s dramatic history.
