        <p>
          Jun Hee Lee grew up in South Korea and received his PhD in 2006 from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). He completed his postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Karin at UC San Diego. He came to the University of Michigan in 2011, and is currently a Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology.<br> <br>

Beyond the laboratory, Lee is also a writer. What began as bedtime stories for his son about Korea’s ancient myths and heroes grew into a passion project: retelling the story of Korea in English for children and families. His work blends legend and history in a way that helps second-generation Korean American children—and curious readers everywhere—discover the beauty, resilience, and heavenly roots of Korea’s past.
