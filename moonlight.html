      History is not only the story of kings and battles—it is also the story of ordinary hearts.  
      As Baekje grew powerful, trade flourished across the land. Merchants journeyed with ox-carts along dusty roads and sailed to distant shores. Yet every road meant someone left behind.  
      <br><br>
      In those quiet villages, a different song rose—not of armies or rulers, but of waiting wives.  
      One such melody became known as the <em>Song of the Moonlight Road</em>.  
      <br><br>
      They say a woman once stood under the moonlight, waiting for her husband who had gone to the market. She worked by day, but at night her heart ached with worry and longing.  
      <br><br>
      And so, she sang to the moon:

        <h4>Old Lyrics (Jeongeupsa)</h4>
O moon, climb high into the night,  
Shine your silver light afar—  
Shine upon the roads he travels,  
Guide him safely home to me.  
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  

Is he still lingering in the marketplace?  
Tell me, moon, where his footsteps go.  
Watch that he not stumble, not falter,  
Nor sink into the dark and troubled mire.  
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  

All the goods he carries, let them be—  
Let him leave them, let them fall aside.  
Only haste, only return, my love—  
Before his heart grows weary, before his flame burns dim.  
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!

        <h4>New Lyrics</h4>
Moonlight light, climb the sky,  
Shine upon the road so high.  
Guide his feet and guard his way,  
Bring him safely home today.  

Moonlight light… climb the sky…  
Moonlight light… guard his way…  

Moonlight light, my heart is weak,  
Moonlight light, the one I seek.  
Do not let him stumble, fall,  
Guide him home through shadows all.  

Moonlight light—ah, ah—  
Moonlight light—ah, ah—  
Guide him back, guide him back,  
Guide him home to me.  

If his hands grow tired and sore,  
Moonlight light, protect him more.  
If his heart grows faint with fear,  
Moonlight light, draw him near.  

Moonlight light… protect him more…  
Moonlight light… draw him near…  

Goods may scatter, gold may fade,  
None of it counts, no price is paid.  
Let the burdens fall aside,  
Only love must be my guide.  

Moonlight light, so pale, so near,  
Take away my trembling fear.  
Tell me where his footsteps go,  
Bring him safe from night’s shadow.  

Moonlight light—ah, ah—  
Moonlight light—ah, ah—  
Guide him back, guide him back,  
Guide him home to me.  

Moonlight light, across the sea,  
Shine the path and let him see.  
If the waters surge and rise,  
Keep him safe beneath your eyes.  

Moonlight light… across the sea…  
Moonlight light… beneath your eyes…  

Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  
Ah, my heart—how it trembles!  

Moonlight light! Moonlight light!  
Guide him—home to me!
