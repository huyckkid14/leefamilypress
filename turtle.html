      Long ago in the land of Gaya, nine village chiefs gathered on a hill called Gujibong—“Turtle Hill.”  
      Their people were many, but they had no ruler to unite them. So the chiefs prayed together, asking the heavens to send them a king.<br><br>
      They danced around the hilltop, stamping their feet and raising their voices in a chant so ancient and powerful that it echoed across the sky:  
      “Turtle, O Turtle! Show us your head! If you will not show it, we will burn you, we will roast you, we will eat you!”<br><br>
      Though it may sound like a threat to modern ears, it was really a sacred plea—a call for the divine to reveal a leader.  
      The turtle represented both the heavens and the earth, and asking it to “show its head” was a way of begging heaven to reveal the one who would guide them.<br><br>
      Then, the heavens answered. From the clouds descended a golden chest holding six radiant eggs.  
      From those eggs were born six boys who would grow into wise kings. The greatest among them was Suro Kim, the first ruler of Golden-Crown Gaya, who led his people into unity and strength.

        <h4>Original Chant</h4>
Turtle, O Turtle!  
Show us your head!  
If you will not show it,  
We will burn you,  
We will roast you,  
We will eat you!

        <h4>New Lyrics</h4>
Turtle, O Turtle!  
Show us your head!  
If you will not show it,  
We will burn you,  
We will roast you,  
We will eat you!  

Knock on the shell—will you answer back?  
Knock-knock! Knock-knock!  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
Till the turtle comes!  
Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
We will all be one!  

River runs steady, sky like a bell,  
Voices together calling the shell.  
Do not be afraid—step into the sun,  
When we keep the rhythm, many hearts are one.  

Send us the one who will unite us!  
Give us the ruler who will guide us!  
Turtle, O Turtle, we will keep you safe.  
Show us your head—come join our pace.  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
Till the turtle comes!  
Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
We will all be one!  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
Let the daylight shine!  
Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
We will walk the line!  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
Voices loud and strong!  
Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
We all sing along!  

Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
Till the turtle comes!  
Show us, show us—Turtle hear our cry,  
We will all be one!  

BUM — BUM — BUM … silence
