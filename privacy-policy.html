  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p><strong>Effective immediately</strong></p>

  <p>Lee Family Press (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining transparency about how we handle your information. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and protect information you provide through our website.</p>

  <h3>I. Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>We only collect information that you voluntarily provide through our contact forms. This may include your name, email address, and the message you send us. We do not collect any other personal information such as addresses, phone numbers, or payment details.</p>
  <p>Our website may also collect limited non-personal information such as general traffic statistics or cookie data for functionality purposes, but no data is used to personally identify you.</p>

  <h3>II. How We Use Information</h3>
  <p>We use the information you submit solely to respond to your inquiries and communicate with you if you have requested a reply. We do not use your information for marketing emails.</p>
  <p>Because our contact forms are powered by Formspree, any information you submit through them is also subject to Formspree’s Privacy Policy: 
  <a href="https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy" style="color:#ffaa00;">https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy</a>.</p>

  <h3>III. How We Share Information</h3>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We only share your data with Formspree for the purpose of processing form submissions. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect the rights and safety of others.</p>

  <h3>IV. Cookies and Non-Personal Data</h3>
  <p>Our website may use basic cookies or analytics to understand general usage patterns such as page views and referral sources. These tools do not personally identify users and are used only to improve experience and performance.</p>

  <h3>V. Children’s Privacy</h3>
  <p>Our website and services are intended for a general audience and are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. If you believe a child has provided us data, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h3>VI. Your Rights</h3>
  <p>If you wish to have your message deleted or reviewed, contact us at <a href="mailto:bestorangelover@gmail.com" style="color:#ffaa00;">bestorangelover@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h3>VII. Links to Other Websites</h3>
  <p>Our Site does not typically contain external links. However, if links to other websites are included (for example, third-party services like Formspree), those sites are governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage users to review them before use.</p>

  <h3>VIII. Changes to This Policy</h3>
  <p>Lee Family Press reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Updates will appear on this page with a revised effective date. We encourage visitors to review it periodically for any changes.</p>
